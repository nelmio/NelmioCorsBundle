# NelmioCorsBundle

## About

The NelmioCorsBundle allows you to send [Cross-Origin Resource Sharing](http://enable-cors.org/)
headers with ACL-style per-URL configuration.

If you want to have a global overview of CORS workflow, you can browse
this [image](http://www.html5rocks.com/static/images/cors_server_flowchart.png).

## Features

* Handles CORS preflight OPTIONS requests
* Adds CORS headers to your responses

## Installation

An official [Symfony Flex](https://symfony.com/doc/current/setup/flex.html) recipe
is available for this bundle.
To automatically install and configure it run:

```bash
composer req cors
```

You're done!

Alternatively, if you don't use Symfony Flex, require the `nelmio/cors-bundle`
package in your `composer.json` and update your dependencies.

    $ composer require nelmio/cors-bundle

Add the NelmioCorsBundle to your application's kernel:

```php
    public function registerBundles()
    {
        $bundles = [
            // ...
            new Nelmio\CorsBundle\NelmioCorsBundle(),
            // ...
        ];
        // ...
    }
```

## Configuration

Symfony Flex generates a default configuration in `config/packages/nelmio_cors.yaml`.

The `defaults` are the default values applied to all the `paths` that match,
unless overridden in a specific URL configuration. If you want them to apply
to everything, you must define a path with `^/`.

This example config contains all the possible config values with their default
values shown in the `defaults` key. In paths, you see that we allow CORS
requests from any origin on `/api/`. One custom header and some HTTP methods
are defined as allowed as well. Preflight requests can be cached for 3600
seconds.

```yaml
    nelmio_cors:
        defaults:
            allow_credentials: false
            allow_origin: []
            allow_headers: []
            allow_methods: []
            expose_headers: []
            max_age: 0
            hosts: []
            origin_regex: false
            forced_allow_origin_value: ~
            skip_same_as_origin: true
        paths:
            '^/api/':
                allow_origin: ['*']
                allow_headers: ['X-Custom-Auth']
                allow_methods: ['POST', 'PUT', 'GET', 'DELETE']
                max_age: 3600
            '^/':
                origin_regex: true
                allow_origin: ['^http://localhost:[0-9]+']
                allow_headers: ['X-Custom-Auth']
                allow_methods: ['POST', 'PUT', 'GET', 'DELETE']
                max_age: 3600
                hosts: ['^api\.']
```

`allow_origin` and `allow_headers` can be set to `*` to accept any value, the
allowed methods however have to be explicitly listed. `paths` must contain at least one item.

If `origin_regex` is set, `allow_origin` must be a list of regular expressions matching
allowed origins. Remember to use `^` and `$` to clearly define the boundaries of the regex.

By default, the `Access-Control-Allow-Origin` response header value is 
the `Origin` request header value (if it matches the rules you've defined with `allow_origin`),
so it should be fine for most of use cases. If it's not, you can override this behavior 
by setting the exact value you want using `forced_allow_origin_value`.

Be aware that even if you set `forced_allow_origin_value` to `*`, if you also set `allow_origin` to `http://example.com`,
only this specific domain will be allowed to access your resources.

> **Note:** If you allow POST methods and have 
> [HTTP method overriding](http://symfony.com/doc/current/reference/configuration/framework.html#http-method-override)
> enabled in the framework, it will enable the API users to perform PUT and DELETE 
> requests as well.

## Cookbook

### How to ignore preflight requests on New Relic?

On specific architectures with a mostly authenticated API, preflight request can represent a huge part of the traffic.

In such cases, you may not need to monitor on New Relic this traffic which is by the way categorized automatically as
`unknown` by New Relic.

A request listener can be written to ignore preflight requests:
```php
use Symfony\Component\HttpKernel\Event\FilterResponseEvent;

class PreflightIgnoreOnNewRelicListener
{
    public function onKernelResponse(FilterResponseEvent $event)
    {
        if (!extension_loaded('newrelic')) {
            return;
        }

        if ('OPTIONS' === $event->getRequest()->getMethod()) {
            newrelic_ignore_transaction();
        }
    }
}
```

Register this listener, and voil√†!
